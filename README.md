This python repository contains the spectrum class.
The spectrum class allow you to plot spectra acquired with the QE-pro raman spectrometer.
It allows you to easily manipulate and visualise the data you acquired.

For now, the way the data is organized is important in order to make the code work.

Also, this class will soon be able to:
  - run a PCA on a bank of spectra
  - apply background removal algorithms on your spectra (polynomial fit, frequency domain filter)
